# Sending and receiving push notifications with Xamarin.Forms and Azure Notification Hub
This repo contains the code for the Lightning Lecture "Push notifications with Azure Notification Hub" available at https://university.xamarin.com/lightninglectures

## Topics covered

* Setup Azure Notification Hub for use with Android, iOS and Windows (UWP)
* Configure FCM for notifications on Android
* Configure APNS for notifications on iOS
* Configure WNS for notifications on Windows
* Build a Xamarin.Forms app to handle notifications
* Implement the platform specific native steps required to receive push notifications
* Implement and deploy a custom Azure Mobile App Service (.NET) to send notifications via the Azure Notification Hub
* Connect the Xamarin.Forms app to the .NET backend

***Please note that the solution requires an active Azure subscription that is available for free at https://portal.azure.com - the Notification Hub and backend used in the lecture are not meant for direct use and will be switched off without further warning.***
